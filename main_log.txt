Matplotlib created a temporary config/cache directory at /tmp/matplotlib-3sraus6m because the default path (/nfs/home/.local/bin/.config/matplotlib) is not a writable directory; it is highly recommended to set the MPLCONFIGDIR environment variable to a writable directory, in particular to speed up the import of Matplotlib and to better support multiprocessing.
